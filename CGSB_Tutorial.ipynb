    "- Individual leaflets in membranes can be created independently of each other.\n",
    "- **Any number of membranes can be created, though overlaps between different membranes is not checked for, so use with caution.**\n",

    "- **All calculations are done on a leaflet-by-leaflet basis**\n",
    "    - **Multiple methods available for optimizing ratio between lipid types within a given leaflet**\n",
    "- **Membranes are created by inserting an exact number of lipids in a leaflet after which the distance between the lipids is \"minimized\" using a custom written algorithm to prevent potential bead overlaps**\n",
    "- **CGSB utilizes the powerful geometry module called \"shapely\" to handle abnormalities present in a membrane (such as protein-occupied areas (Working) and *artificially created holes (WIP)***\n",

    "- **The number of ionic solvent molecules is calculated based on the solvent volume**\n",
    "    - **Estimated using the number of non-ionic solvent particles created using the same command**\n",

    "- **Any number of solvations can be given**\n",
    "- **Structures (pdb/gro) can be imported and used as solvent molecules**\n",
