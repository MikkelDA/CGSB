# ENSANE - Enhanced iNSANE - A coarse-grained system builder
ENSANE (Enhanced iNSANE) can be used to create coarse-grained systems in Martini 3

The program is written completely from scratch only reusing the initial lipid, protein and solvent definitions (though the format has been changed) from the original python2 insane script.

Due to having to finish my masters thesis, changes to ENSANE.py are unlikely to happen before September 2023
